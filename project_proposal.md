| Users      | What kind of users will visit your app? In other words, what is the demographic of your users?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Women, men, teenagers, families and singles who love to cook       |
| Data       | What data do you plan on using? How are you planning on collecting your data? You may have not picked your actual API yet, which is fine, just outline what kind of data you would like it to contain. You are welcome to create your own API and populate it with data. If you are using a Python/Flask stack, you are required to create your own API. |  Food related data(  recipes/ ingredients/ metrics/ nutritional values       |

# Breaking down your project

When planning your project, break down your project into smaller tasks, knowing that you may not know everything in advance and that these details might change later. Some common tasks might include:

- Determining the database schema
- Sourcing your data
- Determining user flow(s)
- Setting up the backend and database
- Setting up the frontend
- What functionality will your app include?
  - User login and sign up
  - Uploading a user profile picture

Here are a few examples to get you started with. During the proposal stage, you just need to create the tasks. Description and details can be edited at a later time. In addition, more tasks can be added in at a later time.

| Task Name                   | Description                                                                                                   |        link                                                                               |
